# Pokemon memory game
This is a project from the Odin Project to practice using UseEffect and collecting data from an API
## How to play
User must click pokemons for points but clicking a pokemon twice will end the game. The goal is to get as many unique pokemons as possible. Once the player has reached the gameover screen, collected pokemons will have a red outline with a pokeball in the background to indicate that they were collected.
## API used
All pokemon names, types, and sprites were gotten from the pokeapi. I believe all 151 pokemons used were from pokemon red/blue
